# ucs-py-tools
A collection of home-grown programs that use Cisco's UCS Python SDK. 

I'm hoping to build a few Programs over the next several weeks that may be of some use to Cisco customers looking to use the UCSM Python SDK.

I'm currently using the UCS Platform Emulator, Python 3.6, and the 'atom' IDE running on Windows. 

Mileage may vary where OS calls are needed against other systems.
